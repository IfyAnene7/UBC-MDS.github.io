## Google Chrome browser
In MDS we will be using many tools that work most reliably on the Google Chrome browser (including our online quiz software). To install it, go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/), click on "Download Chrome" and follow the instructions on the website to finish the installation.

## LastPass password manager
In MDS we share credentials via the password manager LastPass. This can also be useful for helping keep secure passwords and efficient authentication. Sign up for a free LastPass account here: [https://lastpass.com/create-account.php](https://lastpass.com/create-account.php). We also recommend installing the LastPass Chrome Extension available here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd).

## Slack
For our MDS courses and program annoucements, correspondance and course forums we use the communcation tool Slack. Slack can be accessed via the web browser, however we strongly recommend installing the Slack App. The Slack app can be installed from the Mac App Store, or from the Slack website. Installation instructions from the Slack website install method are here: [https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/windows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/windows)

## Visual Studio Code

### Installing

We need a text editor to be able to write complete applications. One is available through Jupyter, but sometimes it is helpful to have a standalone text editor, for this we will be using the open-source text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You can download VS Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/download. At "Select Additional Tasks" make sure that "Add to path" is selected (I also like to select all the other three items - see figure below).

![](/resources_pages/imgs/vs_code.png)

You can test that VS code is installed and can be opened from the Powershell by running the following command:

```
code --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:
```
1.36.1
2213894ea0415ee8c85c5eea0d0ff81ecc191529
x64
```

## GitHub

In MDS we will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) as well as an Enterprise version of GitHub hosted here at UBC, [GitHub.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca). Please follow the set-up instructions for both below.

#### GitHub.com
If you do not yet have one, sign up for a free account at https://github.com/ .

#### GitHub.ubc.ca
For us to add you to the MDS organization on [Github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca) we need you to login using your CWL:

visit [Github.ubc.ca](https://github.ubc.ca) to do this.

This step is required for
- being able to store your work
- all homework submission and grading
- working collaboratively

## Git

We will be using the command line version of Git as well as Git through RStudio. 

Go to <https://git-scm.com/download/win> and a download should automatically start (if not, follow the instructions on that page). After the download has finished, run the installer selecting the following options:
  - On the **Select Components** page, check "On the Desktop" under "Additional icons"
  - On the **Choosing the default editor used by Git** page, select "Use the Nano editor by default" from the drop-down menu
  - For all other pages, use the default options

After installation, test if you were successful by opening the Git Bash program (if you followed the install instructions above, you should now have an icon on your Desktop). Below is a picture of the Git Bash icon on the Desktop and an opened instance of the Git Bash program:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/gitbash.png)

## Python

We will be using Python for a large part of the program, including many popular 3rd party Python libraries for scientific computing. [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com) is an easy-to-install distribution of Python and most of these libraries (as well as Jupyter notebooks, one of the developing environments we will be using). We __strongly recommend__ that you use Anaconda for this program. If you insist on using your own Python setup instead of Anaconda, we will not be able to provide technical support with installation or later issues. For this program we are using __Python 3__ , not __Python 2__, so please choose the Anaconda versions that include Python 3.7

Head to <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows> and download the Anaconda version for Windows with **Python 3.7**. After the download has finished, run the installer selecting the following options:
  - On the **Advanced Installation Options** page, check both boxes (see image below)
  - For all other pages, use the default options

![](/resources_pages/imgs/anaconda_windows.png)

After installation, open Powershell (select the Start button, type powershell, and click Windows Powershell from the list) and type the following:
```
python
```
you should see something like this (in the first line) if you were successful:

```
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 17:13:21) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
```

If instead you see `Python 2.7.X` you installed the wrong version. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall) to delete this installation and try the installation again, selecting **Python 3.7**.

To see if Jupyter was successfully installed in the Anaconda Python distribution, restart Powershell and type the following:

```
jupyter lab
```

A browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. 

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab.PNG)


If you already have installed Anaconda at some point in the past, we recommend that you update to the latest Anaconda version by updating conda. In powershell, type the following:
```
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
```

## R, IRkernel and RStudio
We will be using R, another programming language, a lot in the program. We will use R both in Jupyter notebooks and in RStudio. To have R work in Jupyter notebooks we will also have to install the IR kernel.

### R
Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> and download the latest version of R for Windows (Should look something like this: Download R 3.6.1 for Windows). Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

Note: Although it is possible to install R through Anaconda, we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using Anaconda you can remove it by executing `conda uninstall r-base`.

### RStudio
Chose and download the Windows version of RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

To see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon. It should open and looks something like this picture below:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/RStudio.png)

### Rtools
Windows users will also need to install Rtools, which will allow you to use external libraries. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and download the latest version (e.g., Rtools35.exe). After the download has finished, run the installer selecting the following options:
  - On the **Select Additional Tasks** page, check the Add rtools to system PATH option (see image below)
  - For all other pages, use the default options

![](/resources_pages/imgs/Rtools.png)

To see if you were successful, open RStudio and type ```install.packages("xtable", type="source")``` into the console panel. If this install command runs successfully, Rtools should be installed!


### IR kernel

Open RStudio and type the following commands into the console panel:

```
install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest', 'tidyverse'))
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

To see if you were successful, try running Jupyter Lab and seeing if you have working R kernel. To launch the Jupyter Lab type the following in the Windows Powershell:

```
jupyter lab
```

A browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on "R" notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an Jupyter Lab with an R kernel.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab_r_kernel.png)

Sometimes a kernel loads, but doesn't work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type `library(tidyverse)` in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/jupyter_lab_r_kernel2.png)

### Rscript

To be able to call R scripts from the Powershell or Git Bash you need to be able to execute the Rscript program from there. To make this possible you need to add the the file path of the directory/folder that houses the Rscript program (i.e., location where this program lives on your computer) to the Windows PATH system variable. You can modify the PATH system variable using System Utility in control panel on Windows. We outline below how to do this:

- Hit the windows key to get to the windows search bar and type: `edit environ`
- This should bring up a menu item that will take you to where you can edit the Environment Variables. It should look something like this:

![](/resources_pages/imgs/env1.png)
  
- Double click on the "Path" entry from the top box. This should bring you to a new window titled "Edit Enviroment Variables". 

- Here, click on an empty line and then click **Browse**. This will open a dialogue box within which you can navigate to the folder where Rscript is installed (usually `C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.1\bin`) and click **OK**. Close all remaining windows by clicking **OK**.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/env2.png)

After following the instructions above, restart Powershell and type the following:
``` 
Rscript --version
```
you should see something like this if you were successful:
```
R scripting front-end version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)
```

## PostgreSQL 

We will be using PostgreSQL as our database management system. You can download it from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/thank-you-downloading-postgresql?anid=1256714). Follow the instructions for the installation. In the password page, type whatever password you want, but make sure you'll remember it later. For all the other options, use the default. You can execute `SQL Shell` to test if you were successful.



### Customizing VS Code with Extensions

The real magic of VS Code is in the extensions that let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your specific workflow. From within VS Code you can open up the [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) to browse and install extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar indicated in the figure below.

![](/resources_pages/imgs/vscode.png)

To install an extension, you simply search for it in the search bar, click the extension you want, and then click "Install". There are extensions available to make almost any workflow or task you are interested in more efficient! Here we are interested in setting up VS Code as a Python IDE. To do this, search for and install the following extensions:

- Python (everything Python: notebooks, debugging, linting, formatting, etc.)
- markdownlint (markdown linting and style checking extension)
- GitLens (powerful extension that extends VS Code's native git capabilities)
- Docker (easily use Docker from VS Code)
- (Optional) Material Theme and/or Predawn Theme Kit (additional colour themes to choose from)
- (Optional) Material Icon Theme (great-looking custom file icons!)
- (Optional) Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (add colour to help distinguish your brackets: (), [], {})

This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20) is an excellent introduction to using VS Code in Python.

## LaTeX

Download the installer from [http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe](http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe). After downloading run the `install-tl-windows.exe` file and follow the installation instructions choosing the default options.

*note - if a screen appears titled "Windows protected your PC", click on "More info" link and the "Run anyway" button*

After installation, restart Powershell and type the following to ask for the version:

```
latex --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```

## Make
We will be using Make to automate our analysis scripts. More on this later!

Go to https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools/releases and download `gnu-mcu-eclipse-windows-build-tools-2.12-20190422-1053-win64.zip`. 

Unpack the archive and copy it into the %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse (for example C:\Users\\`user_name`\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse) folder. 

Next, like you did when installing [Rscript](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/blob/master/resources_pages/install_ds_stack_windows.md#rscript), you need to add the folder where `make.exe` is located to the _PATH_ variable. The `make.exe` file is located in C:\Users\\`user_name`\AppData\Roaming\GNU MCU Eclipse\Build Tools\2.12-20190422-1053\bin.

After installation, restart Powershell and type the following to ask for the version:

```
make --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```
GNU Make 4.2.1

## Docker

You will use Docker to create reproducible, sharable and shippable computing environments for your analyses. For this you will need a Docker account. You can sign up for a free one [here](https://store.docker.com/signup?next=%2F%3Fref%3Dlogin).

After signing-up and signing into the Docker Store, go [here](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and click on the "Get Docker" button on the right hand side of the screen. Then follow the installation instructions on that screen.

After installation, restart Powershell and type the following to ask for the version:

```
docker run hello-world
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
